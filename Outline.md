### My project outline

- scarpe station ids, names, latitudes and longitudes for tide stations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration site
- store the station data in a csv file
- find the closest station to a given zip code
- store the closest stations to zip codes in another csv file
- take in a user given zip code and find the closest station 
- scrape tide data about that station from the NOAA site
